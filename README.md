This is one of my favorite projects ‚ù§Ô∏è

It took me a lot of time for polished all to presentable, 
and after all of that there's many things what is not like in layout.

I learned many things with this lovely project:
1. The importance of methodology üò•
   In my first try i don't used methodology at all.
   i thought i don't need it, this is a small project and don't have many details.
   After couple of hours trying to understand what the hell i created in scss i gave up and start all from white list.
2. How cool 'display: flex' actually is üòé
   Don't understand why I didn't start using it sooner.
   Adaptive layout one love
3. Many things for js ü§©
   Before this project i don't know many thing about objects and how to use it,
   but after trying create eventListener for 5 buttons via "switch",
   where 70% of code it's same function call, break, and assignment operation for tip.
   Now i think twice how can i get rid of repetitions.
   Don't Repeat Yourself

If you find any shortcomings please give me feedback!
This will help me learn even more new things and get even closer to my dream.!!!
